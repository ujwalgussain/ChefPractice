Q) What are the restrictions that are applied to the Java static methods?
Ans:    Two main restrictions are applied to the static methods.
        1. The static method can not use non-static data member or call the non-static method directly.
        2. this and super cannot be used in static context as they are non-static

Q)Can we override the static methods?
  Ans: No, we can't override static methods.

Q) Can we make constructors static?
    Ans :no
Q) What is this keyword?
   Ans: it is a final reference which points to current object.
Q)Can we assign the reference to this variable?
  Ans: No, this cannot be assigned to any value because it always points to the current class object and this is the final reference in Java
Q) Can this keyword be used to refer static members?
Ans:Yes, It is possible to use this keyword to refer static members because this is just a reference variable which refers to the current class object.

Q) Why is Inheritance used in Java?
Ans:
    There are various advantages of using inheritance in Java that is given below.
        Inheritance provides code reusability. The derived class does not need to redefine the method of base class unless it needs to provide the specific implementation of the method.
        Runtime polymorphism cannot be achieved without using inheritance.
        We can simulate the inheritance of classes with the real-time objects which makes OOPs more realistic.
        Inheritance provides data hiding. The base class can hide some data from the derived class by making it private.
        Method overriding cannot be achieved without inheritance. By method overriding, we can give a specific implementation of some basic method contained by the base class.
