1> FixedTP:
    blocking queue
2> CachedTP: - for short lived tasks
   donot have fixed no of threads.
   uses synchronous queue() which can store only one task. check if any thread is idle. if not create new thread.
   if thread is idle more than 60 sec kills the thread.

3> ScheduledTP - schedule tasks after certain delay.
    uses delay queue(arranges tasks according to delay).
    For eg: We need to perform login checks after every 10 sec. use scheduleAtFixedRate()

        ScheduledExecutorService svc = Executors.newScheduledTP(10);
        //run after 10 sec delay
        svc.schedule(new Task(), delay:10, SECONDS);
        //run repeatedly after 10 sec delay
        svc.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Task(),initialDelay:15, period:10, SECONDS);
        //run repeatedly after 10 sec delay after previous task completes.
        sc.scheduleWithFixedDelay(new Task(), initialDelay:15,delay:10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        class Task implements Runnable{ ... }

4>SingleThreadedExecutor:
    size of Queue is 1.
    If task throws an Exception and Thread is killed it recreate it.
