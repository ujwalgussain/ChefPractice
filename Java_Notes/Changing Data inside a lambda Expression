Any local variable, formal parameter, or exception parameter used but not declared in a lambda expression
must either be declared final or be effectively final (ยง4.12.4), or a compile-time error occurs where the use is attempted.

To overcome this, we can come up with 3 potential solutions:

1. Making the variable static.
2. Use Array
3. Atomic Integer
