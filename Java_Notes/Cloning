The process of creating exactly duplicate Object is called cloning.
The main purpose of cloning is to maintain backup copy and to preserve state of an Object.
If something goes wrong we can access the org Object.
We can perform cloning by using clone() method of Object class
    protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

Ex:
    public class Test implements Cloneable{
        int i=10,j=20;

        public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
            CloningSample s = new CloningSample();
            CloningSample s1 =(CloningSample)s.clone();
            System.out.println(s1.i+" "+s1.j);
        }
    }

If Test doesn't implement Cloneable we will get Runtime Error CloneNotSupportedException

We can perform only for cloneable Objects.
An Object is said to be Cloneable, if and only if the corresponding class implements Cloneable interface.
Cloneable interface is present in java.lang package. It is a marker Interface.
If we are trying to perform cloning for non cloneable Objects then we will get runtimeexception - CloneNotSupportedException


Shallow Cloning and Deep Cloning:
Ex :
class Dog implements Cloneable{
    int i=10;
    Cat c= new Cat();//contained Object
}
The process of creating Bitwise Copy of an Object is called Shallow Cloning.

In shallow Cloning for main Object:
    For primitive variables - a seperate copy is created.
    For Object references - a duplicate reference will be created pointing to the same Object as the original and no new Object is created.
Object class clone() is meant for shallow cloning
Ex:
    class Cat{
        int c;
        Cat(int x)
        {
            c=x;
        }
    }
    class Dog implements Cloneable
    {
        int d;
        Cat cat;
        Dog(int d, Cat c)
        {
            this.cat=c;
            this.d = d;
        }
        public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
        {
            return super.clone();
        }
    }

Deep Cloning:
The process of Creating exactly independent duplicate Object is called Deep Cloning.
In Deep Cloning if the main Object contains any primitive variables then in the clone Object duplicate variables will be created.
If main Object contains any contained Object then in the clone Object duplicate Objects will be created.
By default Object class clone method meant for shallow cloning but we can implement deep cloning explicity by overriding clone method in our class.
Ex:
class Cat{
    int c;
    Cat(int x)
    {
        c=x;
    }
}
class Dog implements Cloneable
{
    int d;
    Cat cat;
    Dog(int d, Cat c)
    {
        this.cat=c;
        this.d = d;
    }
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
    {
        Cat c1 = new Cat(cat.c);
        Dog d1 = new Dog(d,c1);
        return d1;
    }
}

Which one is best?
If Object contains only primitive variables then shallow Cloning is best choice.
If Object contains reference variables then Deep Cloning is best choice.
