#Abstract Class:
    A class which has abstract method must be declared abstract.
    But a abstract class may or may not contain abstract methods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
#Abstract Method:
   The first concrete subclass of an abstract class must implement all abstract methods of the superclass.


Q) Can there be an abstract method without an abstract class?
No, if there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.

Q) Consider the following scenario:
interface i1{
    public void m1();
}
abstract class Sample implements i1{
    //Does it need to implement m1() -> No. The first concrete subclass has to implementv ******
}
