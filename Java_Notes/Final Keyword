Q) Can you declare the main method as final?
Yes, We can declare the main method as public static final void main(String[] args){}.

Q) What is the final Keyword?
    Final Variable
        In Java, the final variable is used to restrict the user from updating it.
        If we initialize the final variable, we can't change its value.
    Final Blank Variable:
        Instance - A non-static final blank variable which is not initialized can only be assigned through the class constructor.
        Eg:
            class B
            {
                final int Z;
                B(int x)
                {
                    Z=x;
                }
            }
        Static- A static final blank variable which is not initialized can only be assigned through a static block.
        Eg:
            class B
            {
                final static int Z;
                static
                {
                    Z=x;
                }
             }
        Local- It can be assigned value directly.
        Eg:
            public static void m1(){
               final int i;
               i = 20;
               System.out.println(i);
            }
        Or else gives an Compilation Error: "Variable might not have been Initialized"

Q) Can we declare a constructor as final?
Ans: No.
    The constructor can never be declared as final because it is never inherited. Constructors are not ordinary methods;
    therefore, there is no sense to declare constructors as final. However, if you try to do so, The compiler will throw an error.

Q)  Can we declare an interface as final?
   No, we cannot declare an interface as final because the interface must be implemented by some class to provide its definition.
   Therefore, there is no sense to make an interface final. However, if you try to do so, the compiler will show an error.
