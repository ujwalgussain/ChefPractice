Q> Why are wait(), notify(), notifyAll() are present in Object class not in Thread Class?
Ans: Because we obtain locks on objects. Postbox and Threads Example.
    If a thread wants to acquire lock of object it must be the owner of the object ie., must have lock of that object.
    Ownership can be obtained using synchronized blocks.
    Hence to call wait(), notify(), notifyAll() on any object, Thread must be owner of the object. ie.,must be in Synchronized blocks of that objects
    Otherwise we will get IllegalMonitorStateException.

When thread calls wait() it immediately releases the lock of that object and enters into waiting state.
When thread calls notify, it releases the lock of that object  but not immediately.
Except wait(), notify(), notifyAll() thread doesn't releases lock. ************.

If notify() is done before wait() then the thread will wait forever.
