Given an array A having N integers .Two elements of the array  and  are called similar iff Ai = Aj+1  or Aj = Ai+1 .
Also, the similarity follows transitivity. If Ai   and Aj are similar and  Aj and Ak are similar, then Ai and Ak are also similar.
Note: i,j ,k and  are all distinct.

You need to find number of pairs of indices  such that (i<j)  and  Ai is similar to Aj.

Input

The first line contains a single integer  denoting number of elements in the array.
The second line contains  space separated integers where  elements indicate.

Output

Output the number of pairs of indices  such that  and  is similar to  in a single line.
