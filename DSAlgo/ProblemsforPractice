    1)Naive Approach 2)Efficient Approach C:\Users\capiot\IdeaProjects\ChefPractice\src\PythagoreanTripletImpl.java

Max subarray sum(Divide&Conquer, Kadane's)
MO's Algo for range sum/max/min
Find longest Increasing Sequence
Print all possible permutations of string
Find whether a string can be rearranged to become palindrome. ** Count min swaps to make string palindrome
    (if strlen is even then occurence of all chars should be even else one char occurence can be odd)
Find k largest elements in array
    Approach 1: Bubble sort
    Approach 2: use temp[k] add first k elems in temp[] and find min.for each element x after k to length if x > min of temp replace min and find new min
    Approach 3: use max heap
    Approach 4: sort array.\\

Stacks:
Find next greatest/smallest element in array.
Find no of smaller elements to the left of an array
Implement Queue using stack

LinkedList:
Print middle of list 1) use fast slow ptrs
Reverse a linked list 1) Stack 2) in O(1)
Delete a node from the linked list where the pointer to that node is given and head pointer is not given.
	Step 1 insert a copy of node after the node.
	Step 2 Add org.next.random=org.random.next;
	Step 3: Remove all duplicate Nodes
Clone a Linked list having next and random pointer(can point to any other node in a linked list).
	Ans: 1. Replace the data of node to be deleted with next node data.
	     2. Now delete next node as normal delete
