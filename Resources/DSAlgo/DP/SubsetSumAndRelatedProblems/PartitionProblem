Partition Problem:
Check whether an array can be partitioned into K parts with Equal Sum.
Ex:
    a[] = {1,5,5,11}
    S1: Find total Sum of the array:
        1+5+5+11=22
    S2: Check if Array can be partitioned
        if(totalsum%K == 0)
            then it is possible to divide the array
        else
            not possible
        As 22%2==0 partitioning is possible
    S3: Perform Subset Sum for sum = sum/K
