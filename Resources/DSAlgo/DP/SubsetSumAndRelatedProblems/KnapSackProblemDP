Here we need to use a similar approach as Subset Sum
Each Cell i j represents the max profit possible with sum=i and set of elements from 0 to j-1
Ex:
     int wt[] = {1,2,3};
     int cost[] = {10,15,40};
     w=6

	0	1	2	3
0	0	0	0	0
1	0	10	10	10
2	0	10	15	15
3	0	10	25	40
4	0	10	25	50
5	0	10	25	55
6	0	10	25	65

For each cell i j
    val1 = In left column on previous row go arr[j-1] times up + cost[j-1]
    val2 = dp[i][j-1] ie cell to the left
    cell(i,j) = max of val1 and val2
