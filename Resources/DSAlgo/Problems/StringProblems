Find longest substring with non repeating characters.
Find first non repeating/repeating character
Print all possible permutations of string
Find whether a string can be rearranged to become palindrome.(if strlen is even then occurence of all chars should be even else one char occurence can be odd)

 Palindrome:
        Note: A Palindromic String will have even no of occurences of each digit.
