Heaps:
Time Complexity:
    buildHeap -> O(n)
    extract -> 0(log n)
    increase -> 0(log n)
    insert   -> 0(log n)

INSERT(S, x) inserts the element x into the set S, which is equivalent to the operation.
MAXIMUM(S) returns the element of S with the largest key.
EXTRACT-MAX(S) removes and returns the element of S with the largest key.
    HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)
    1 if A.heap-size < 1
    2 error “heap underflow”
    3 max =A[1]
    4 A[1]=A[A.heap-size]
    5 A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
    6 MAX-HEAPIFY(A,1)
    7 return max
INCREASE-KEY(S, x, k) increases the value of element x’s key to the new value k,
which is assumed to be at least as large as x’s current key value.
