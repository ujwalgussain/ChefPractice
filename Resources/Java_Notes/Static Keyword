Things you can mark as static:
    ■ Methods
    ■ Variables
    ■ JavaInterviewQuestionsImpl.A class nested within another class, but not within a method
    ■ Initialization blocks

Things you can't mark as static:
    ■ Constructors (makes no sense; a constructor is used only to create instances)
    ■ Classes (unless they are nested)
    ■ Interfaces
    ■ Method local inner classes (we'll explore this in Chapter 8)
    ■ Inner class methods and instance variables
    ■ Local variables.
