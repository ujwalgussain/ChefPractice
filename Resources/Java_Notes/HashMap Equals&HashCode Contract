What is initial Capacity and load factor of HashMap?

Internal Working of HashMap:

What if we override hashCode/equals method?
In both the cases we will end up having DUPLICATE KEYS in hashMap.
with map.get() we will have following cases:
    In Both Cases we if the object which is INSERTED is used as key, we will get the corresponding entry otherwise we will get null.

    If Only HashCode is Overridden then

    Map With HashCode override {[ID-1, Name=Adarsh]=e1, [ID-2, Name=Ujwal]=e2, [ID-2, Name=Ujwal]=e2_duplicate, [ID-2, Name=Ujwal]=e2_clone, [ID-3, Name=Rama]=e3, [ID-4, Name=Dinesh]=e4}

    Same Object as inserted is used then
    	map1.get(e2)-e2
    	map1.get(e2_duplicate) - e2_duplicate
    	map1.get(e2_clone) - e2_clone
    Different Object is used then
    	map1.get(new EmployeeWithHashCode(1,"Ujwal")) - null
    	map1.get((EmployeeWithHashCode) e2.clone()) - null

    If Only Equals is Overridden then

    Map With Equals override {[ID-2, Name=Ujwal]=e2_duplicate, [ID-3, Name=Rama]=e3, [ID-2, Name=Ujwal]=e2, [ID-1, Name=Adarsh]=e1, [ID-2, Name=Ujwal]=e2_clone, [ID-4, Name=Dinesh]=e4}
    Same Object as inserted is used then
    	map1.get(e2) -  e2
    	map1.get(e2_duplicate) - e2_duplicate
    	map1.get(e2_clone) - e2_clone
    Different Object is used then
    	map1.get(new Employee(1,"Ujwal")) -null
    	map1.get((EmployeeWithEquals) e2.clone()) - null
