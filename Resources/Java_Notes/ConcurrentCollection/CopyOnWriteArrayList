This is a thread safe ArrayList.
Thread safety is achieved by creating a clone of the current object and then performing updation for each update operation.
Hence the name
This is not at all recommended for large no of write operations.
Extra method:
addIfAbsent()
addAllAbsent()

It is similar to ArrayList except that its iterator is fail safe and doesn't allow remove operation.
