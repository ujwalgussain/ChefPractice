NoClassDefFoundError:
For HardCoded Class Name if .class file not found at runtime then
Ex: Test t = new Test(); -> If Test .class file not found during runtime then

ClassNotFoundException:
For Dynamically provided className, if .class file not found during runtime
Ex: Object o = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance(); -> If className specified by args[0] not found
This is a checked exception. Hence JVM makes the programmer to handle the case when class is not found.
